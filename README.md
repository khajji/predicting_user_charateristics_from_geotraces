# predicting_user_charateristics_from_geotraces
A model that predicts user characteristics (ex: Age, Gender,..) From places visited by users

Contains a pdf file that explains the problem, the model and compares the performance of the model with common techniques (Naive Bayes, SVM) on a geo localised tweeter dataset.
Also contains a pptx file that briefly explains the model and the results. 

This model was coded and tested using Java and Python.
The dataset was built using Hadoop and Google Maps API.
